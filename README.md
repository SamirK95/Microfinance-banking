# Microfinance-banking
This is microfinance-banking demo application.
For developing this application I'm use ASP.NET, C#, SQL and CSS.
If you want to clone this project to the visual studio, you need to update DOM. 
After cloning project to the folder, open it with visual studio and in the solution explorer 
right click on the solution and go to Manage NuGet Packages and click tab-update, 
select the whole project and click update. After that it's updated, and you can use this project.
Of course you need to connect database in server explorer with your credientials and 
make change in webconfig datasource.
